## How It's Made:
Using Express for server backend, axios for HTTP requests, and Cheerio to parse markups.

## Lessons Learned:
Understanding how Cheerio provides jQuery-like syntax, enables javascript to be used in web-scraping in server-side implementations.


## Things to improve:
Due to short amount of time, I didn't scrape the data I wanted to and save them to database.
