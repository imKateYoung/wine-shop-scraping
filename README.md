# Wine-shop-scraping
This is a small project scraping data from a wine-ecommerce website

## How It's Made:
Using Express for server backend, axios for HTTP requests, and Cheerio to parses markups.

## Lessons Learned:
Understanding how Cheerio provides jQuery-like syntax, enables javascript to be used in web-scraping in server-side implementations.


## Things to improve:
With short amount of time, I didn't scrape the data I wanted to.
